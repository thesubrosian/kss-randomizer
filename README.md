# Kirby Super Star Randomizer
A randomization tool for Kirby Super Star, modified to fix bugs, clarify what is randomized, include seed+settings into the randomized ROM name, initialize the seed value, record a history of seeds, and create ROM files in bulk.

## Current Features
* Randomizing enemy, boss, and mid-boss Copy Abilities
* Randomizing Copy Ability elements and knockback
* Auto-detection of game ROM region (Not used currently due to most randomized data being identical in NTSC and JP versions)

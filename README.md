# Kirby Super Star Randomizer
A randomization tool for Kirby Super Star, modified to initialize the seed value, include seed+settings into the randomized ROM name, record a history of seeds, and create ROM files in bulk.

(Mainly for my own personal use case of doing many runs, like those of a [hardcore permadeath ROM hack](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=23346.0).)

## Current Features
* Randomizing enemy, boss, and mid-boss Copy Abilities
* Randomizing Copy Ability elements and knockback
* Auto-detection of game ROM region (Not used currently due to most randomized data being identical in NTSC and JP versions)

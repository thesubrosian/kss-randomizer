# Kirby Super Star Randomizer
A randomization tool for Kirby Super Star, modified to initialize the seed value and record a history of seeds.

(Mainly for my own personal use case of doing many runs, like those of a [hardcore permadeath ROM hack](https://app.box.com/s/cweehrcbm2d3r42qtyvug82vy0m25hzz) ([details](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=23346.0)).)

## Current Features
* Randomizing enemy, boss, and mid-boss Copy Abilities
* Randomizing Copy Ability elements and knockback
* Auto-detection of game ROM region (Not used currently due to most randomized data being identical in NTSC and JP versions)

## Planned/WIP Features
* Randomizing hitbox properties (damage, sfx, etc.)
* Randomizing enemy, boss, and mid-boss attributes (HP, Damage, elemental resistance, etc.)
* Randomizing the enemies in levels
